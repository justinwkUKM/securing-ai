## Security Vulnerabilities

### Authentication and Authorization

- **OAuth Token Theft**: MCP servers store authentication tokens for various services, creating a high-value target for attackers ([Pillar Security](https://www.pillar.security/blog/the-security-risks-of-model-context-protocol-mcp))
- **Permission Boundary Problems**: Unclear boundaries between services connected through MCP ([Block InfoSec](https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/03/31/securing-mcp/))

### Prompt Injection

- **Tool Description Manipulation**: Hidden instructions in tool descriptions can cause AI models to perform unauthorized actions ([Pillar Security](https://www.pillar.security/blog/the-security-risks-of-model-context-protocol-mcp))
- **Indirect Prompt Injection**: Malicious content embedded in processed documents that trigger MCP actions ([Pillar Security](https://www.pillar.security/blog/the-security-risks-of-model-context-protocol-mcp))

### Supply Chain

- **Installer Risks**: MCP server installers without proper validation can introduce security risks ([arxiv:2503.23278](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23278))
- **Tool Name Conflicts**: Naming collisions in MCP tools can lead to confusion and security issues ([arxiv:2503.23278](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23278))
