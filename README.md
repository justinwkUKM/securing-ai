# Securing AI 🔐🤖
*A curated, community‑driven catalogue of tools, frameworks, datasets, and best‑practice guides for **securing, red‑teaming, and monitoring AI systems**.*

> **Why?** Modern AI introduces new attack surfaces—from adversarial inputs to prompt injections and model leaks. Staying on top of defensive tooling and guidance is hard. **Securing AI** brings the ecosystem together in one place so practitioners can discover, compare, and contribute the resources they need.
